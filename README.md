#### Multitemporal Analysis of Seasonal Burns in Burkina Faso

by Jyoti Biswas, Magdalena Fischer, Lallu Prathapan and Ina Schulz
## Overview of the Study Area

The study area lies in the western part of Burkina Faso, which is covered in this WASCAL Data Cube.
In Burkina Faso, the dry season lasts from November to February, with heavy rainfall during the wet season from May to September.
The land cover in this area is made up of dry, tropical rainforest in between of agricultural lands. There are fequent burns, both of anthropogenic and natural causes. However, vegetation recovers quickly without a change in land cover due to the fire (Liu et al. 2021).

In general, an increase in land cover conversion from forest to agricultural land has been noted in the past decade (Gessner et al. 2015).

The region of interest for this exemplary application was chosen based on qualitative analysis of the FIRMS Fire Map by NASA. Tere Forest is a National Forest of Burkina Faso. With an average elevation of 340 m above sea level (asl) it rises above the surrounding planes (Google Earth 2022).
The forest itself is not used for crop farming, which is in strong contrast to the agricultrurally used lands surrounding the forest. These are still littered with trees within fields or along borders.

THe script focuses on calutlating the NBR and dNBR as well as comparing the results with hotspot data from MODIS and land surface tempretaure analysis.
